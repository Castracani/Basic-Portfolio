<!-- This unfortunately is not 100% complete, but it was what I was (mostly) capable of given the time constraints. The two most prominent errors that I've realized were the issues with my header and my footer, as well as extremely sloppy coding. For the header, I believe that I approached it wrong when using two <div> containers without using an actual <header> tag, which ultimately made it so my border dividers for my Nav Links weren't visible. They are there, but no matter what I tried to do they wouldn't appear. Instead of using a proper header tag, I used h1, which at glance doesn't seem right, but I didn't have it in me to go tinker with the css and make the requisite changes. As to my footer, the "sticky" tutorial that I read made it so the bottom 50px of the body content isn't visible. This can be seen with on my portfolio.html page. And the overall sloppiness of the css (and HTML probably too) is from only getting portions of one approach to work at a time, therefore requiring seven or so approaches to get it to look like the reference material. Some of the stuff was useless, some was vital; I couldn't find everything of the former. -->

            Hi there, thanks for stopping by my Web site! My name is William Myers, and you're in for a treat when you're reading my
            bio. I don't mean to brag or anything, but I'm a talented individual when it comes to this type of stuff. I've
            been professionally tested on my bio writing capabilites, and I've scored five standard deviations above the
            mean according to internationally recoginized standards. I'm basically a celebrity in my hometown; in fact the
            town council unanimously voted to erect a statue of me just last month (send me your fanmail
            <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">here!</a>).
        </p>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>

        <br>

        <p class="p2">
            I love going out and stretching myself to bask in the Florida sun, and I also love going for a quick dip in the water and
            swim lazily around until something catches my attention. That attention-getter is typically food, and nothing
            gets me going like a nice thick tender cut of meat! Now I know some of you reading this are the picky type, but
            I count my blessings each and everytime I catch myself somethin' juicy. Cow, pig, deer, turkey... whatever it
            may be, it's getting in my stomach ASAP. Now something I can't stand is the cold! I'm in Florida for a reason!
            Just the thought of frost on the grass makes me shiver.
